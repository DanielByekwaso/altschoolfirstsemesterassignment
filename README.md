Altschool First Semester Assignment

Altschool First Semester Assignment,
With a content that's not yet relevant.
The page is blank, as white as snow,
Ideas, where did you go?

I've found my pen, I've found my pad,
My brain feels a bit like an ad:
"No thoughts in here!" it proudly displays,
Not the best of all my days.

It's due tomorrow, nine AM sharp,
As I gaze upon the water carp.
Maybe if I lived underwater,
My assignment wouldn't seem much harder.

The textbook's open, pages wide,
A billion words my eyes can't hide.
But my mind, it makes a daring leap,
Instead of work, why not take a sleep?

In dreams of math and history,
The answers could come, a mystery!
Pythagoras and Caesar might appear,
And whisper the answers in my ear.

I've tried to write, to scribble, to type,
About the ecosystem, and the wildlife hype,
But my pen just draws a grumpy cat,
I'm pretty certain we're not studying that.

Oh, first semester, you wicked beast,
With assignments that never seem to cease.
I'll conquer you, you wait and see,
For now, though, a break for tea!

So here's the tale, as yet untold,
Of a student, brave and bold,
With his first semester assignment plight,
In the Altschool, one summer night.
